# homestead-law

**Homestead · Affairs — module one.** The household handling its own deeds and
disputes. Prose name: **Law Gazelle**.

A **self-contained** desktop module: it ships to a self-represented parent or a
legal-aid clinic who double-clicks it, so its store is embedded **SQLite** — a
linked library, not a server (the face's 2026-08-04 "no listening socket"
decision holds; SQLite binds no port). It **pins `homestead.keep`** — the
import-pure record, deadline, rung and gate core — by immutable ref, and shares
the `~/.homestead` root with the ledger module, because a household's affairs are
one thing.

The shared **Postgres** engine on the fleet side (the Willow side of the die) is
a *sync target*, reached through the egress gate — never a runtime dependency of
the shipped app. Sync is an **S4 egress**: an `L5` record never crosses, and what
lands in the shared store is only what the household chose to expose.

> **Status: bite 1 — the store.** The record layer, re-seated from
> `homestead.keep`'s file sidecar onto a SQLite table. Suite: **15 passed**. The
> matter packs, the registry, the queue and the app are extracted onto this store
> next.

## What is enforced here today

*The record invariants, carried from `homestead.keep.record` and held more
tightly by the database.*

| | |
|---|---|
| **I-6** | The canonical record is **read-only, enforced by type**. `Canonical` reads the canonical table and has no `put`/`update`/`delete`; `Sidecar` writes its own. The Postgres sync target is the shared canonical on the fleet side. |
| **I-7** | **One key.** `(matter, item_type, item_id)` is the composite **primary key**, computed once by `key()`, shared by read and write. Two call sites cannot derive it two ways (BUG-11). |
| **I-9** | **Writes never silently overwrite.** A first write is an `INSERT`; the primary key makes a racing second write an `IntegrityError`, refused — race-safe by the database, no lock. An explicit overwrite reports what it replaced. |
| **I-11** | **Absence fails closed to `L5`** at the storage boundary. A row whose rung is missing, unreadable, or whose payload will not decode reads `L5` on the way out — never `L1` — using the same `rungs._read_rung` the gate uses. |

## The method

Test-first, as in `homestead`: every claim is a check somebody can run. From a
cold checkout with the engine on the path:

```bash
pip install -e .    # pins homestead.keep
pytest -q
```

MIT.
