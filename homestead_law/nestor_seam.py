"""nestor_seam.py -- the ONLY place this module touches Nestor.

Nestor is Apache-2.0 with ``dependencies = []``.  Nothing here obliges a
household to install a dependency tree.

**Nestor is an OPTIONAL EXTRA** (``pyproject.toml``'s
``[project.optional-dependencies] entity``), never a required dependency.
Every function here degrades to *feature absent* when Nestor is not
installed -- nothing here raises on import, nothing here crashes a surface.

  EntityResolver(store, domain=...)                        nestor.entity
      .resolve(surface) -> dict      read-only; fuzzy-match a surface form
                                     against sealed aliases
      .seal(surface, canonical, verifier=...)             human-initiated write
      .add_alias(surface, canonical, verifier=...)        human-initiated write

  Domains for this module:
      "court"          -- courts and tribunals
      "party"          -- litigants, respondents, petitioners
      "citation"       -- case citations and statutory references
      "jurisdiction"   -- jurisdictional authorities

  DecisionMemory(store, domain=...)                        nestor.decision
      Sealed decisions with graph edges -- legal decisions, rulings,
      dispositions.  The same injected-store, domain-scoped contract as
      EntityResolver.

  Storage                                                  nestor.storage
      A Protocol.  Nestor owns no persistence -- "a concrete implementation
      is *injected* by the host."  Both ``resolver_for()`` and
      ``decisions_for()`` take the store as a parameter rather than
      constructing one; a SQLite (or other) adapter conforming to the
      Protocol is this module's own build item, not this seam's.

  set_ledger_path(path)                                    nestor.cascade
      REQUIRED.  See PRECONDITIONS.  ``bind()`` calls this -- it is the only
      function in this module that changes where Nestor's audit trail lives.

  ledger.verify(path, expected_head=...)                   nestor.ledger
      Verify the chain on read/boot.  A broken chain is a refusal upstream
      of this call -- ``verify_ledger()`` reports ``False`` for the caller to
      act on.

===========================================================================
NOT TAKEN   (deliberate -- the omissions carry as much weight as the takings)
===========================================================================

  nestor.cascade translation pipeline   translate_text, translate_segment,
      graduate_segment.  Translation is not this module's domain.

  nestor.matcher / nestor.semantic_matcher   reached only through
      EntityResolver.  Never imported directly; that is how the surface widens.

  nestor.serve / nestor.ui / nestor.ui_page   an HTTP server.  ``ui.py``
      imports ``http.server`` and ``urllib.parse`` at module level, which
      would put a network import in the import-pure core.  It is not imported
      here, anywhere, ever.

  nestor.reconcile   numeric reconciliation.  Not our business.

  nestor.answer * curator * frank * glossary * langid * segment * calibrate
      * portable * keyring * signing * memory * embedding_store
      * sqlite_store * engine * cli
      Not our business.  Some are excellent.  Not ours.

  THE ``cloud`` EXTRA  (``anthropic``)  -- MUST NEVER BE INSTALLED ON THIS
      MODULE.  This module's premise is that nothing leaves the device.

  THE ``semantic`` EXTRA  (``fastembed``) -- license discrepancy unresolved.
      Unused.

===========================================================================
PRECONDITIONS   -- all three MUST hold before any Nestor call in this process
===========================================================================

1.  THE LEDGER IS PINNED INSIDE ``<household root>/keep/ledger.jsonl``.

    Nestor's hash-chained ledger is **not part of the Storage protocol** --
    injecting the store does not cover it.  Unbound, it resolves
    independently to ``data/ledger.jsonl`` relative to the working directory:
    outside the household root, outside anything this module's own rules
    reach.  ``bind()`` exists to close that window before any other Nestor
    call in this process -- see ``SeamNotBoundError``.

    The path is resolved by ``homestead.keep.paths.home()`` -- the one module
    permitted to resolve a home directory (I-19/I-20) -- and never by
    Nestor's own household resolver, so there is one resolver on this side of
    the boundary, not two that could drift.

2.  THE STORE IS PASSED EXPLICITLY, NEVER SET GLOBALLY.

    ``nestor.storage`` offers ``set_store()`` as a process-wide global.  This
    seam does not call it.  ``resolver_for()`` and ``decisions_for()`` require
    the caller's ``store`` explicitly.

3.  NESTOR IS PINNED TO A TAG.

    ``>=0.11.0,<1.0``, never a branch on anything that ships.

===========================================================================
FOR AGENTS AND FUTURE READERS
===========================================================================

Nestor is a PINNED DEPENDENCY consumed only through this file.  Do not
modify it, do not propose changes to it, and do not move logic from this
module into it.

Covenant: this seam never seals anything on its own initiative.
``EntityResolver.seal`` / ``.add_alias`` are human-initiated writes upstream
of this module (a caller passes a ``verifier=``); nothing here calls them,
and nothing here manufactures a ``verifier``.  A machine proposes; only a
named human seals.
