"""A synthetic custody matter, for seeing the surfaces work end to end (bite 4).

**Synthetic data only** — the plan holds real data until the ledger is wired, and
this writes to a throwaway store, never a real household root. It seeds one
custody matter into the sidecar and composes the list and a detail through the
gate, so the store → `serve` → surface pipeline can be run and read without a
display: `python -m homestead.app --demo`.

The values are invented; the rungs are the custody pack's, so what renders where
is the real crossing, not a mock. `courthouse`/`hearing_date` (L1) and `ssn` (L5)
carry no derived form; the L3/L4 fields carry one, because that is the human
re-identification judgement `Classified` requires and a pack does not author.
