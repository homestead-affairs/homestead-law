"""The urgent queue — what the season owes, across every matter.

*A homesteader knows what the season owes.* This is that: the deadlines across a
household's matters, sorted by what needs a hand first. It is also the module
BUG-6 was about — the predecessor's urgent queue hardcoded its matter list and
workers' comp fell out of it, never iterated. This one calls `all_matters()`
(the registry, I-23) and nothing else, so a matter type that exists is a matter
type the queue reaches, by construction.

**It reaches no payload.** The store is the payload boundary: `Sidecar.deadlines`
parses each date and serves the display there, handing back `Due`s. The queue
computes urgency over the parsed date, sorts, and counts — it never sees a raw
payload, and the chokepoint holds.

**Urgency is operational; the specifics are gated.** `days_until` and `overdue`
are computed from the date so the queue can order and count. What the operator
*sees* for each item is the `Due`'s `shown` — the date for `L1`–`L3`, the derived
instruction for `L4` — already through the gate. A sealed (`L5`) deadline is not
in the queue at all. And a deadline whose stored date will not parse is a **gap**
(I-8): surfaced at the top, flagged, never silently dropped.

The **cover** counts (I-31) are the queue's aggregate passed through the
re-identification check, so the resting screen shows a number only where it
reveals nothing about which matter it came from.
