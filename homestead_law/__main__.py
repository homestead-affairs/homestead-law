"""homestead-law's entry point.

**I-21: no auto-render on start.** The resting state is the cover; `view.run`
opens on it and draws the list only when the operator opens a matter.

**I-29: the surface holds no domain logic.** The entry point routes to `view`,
which composes through `Window` over the SQLite store and calculates nothing.

Four ways in, plus `--help`:
  * `--help` / `-h` — print this usage and exit 0. Never opens a window.
  * `--smoke` — start, prove every import survived packaging, exit without a
    display. What CI runs against the built artifact.
  * `--demo` — seed a synthetic custody matter into a throwaway store and print
    the list and a detail, composed through the gate. The pipeline, headless, on
    SQLite.
  * a CLI command (resolve, propose, orders, put, deadline, queue, verify) —
    real work on real data, wired through Nestor's entity resolution and
    decision memory. Operates on the household root, not a throwaway.
  * default — open the tkinter view on the cover. On a box with no tkinter or
    no display, this fails legibly: a one-line message pointing at `--demo` and
    `--smoke`, and a non-zero exit — never a raw `ModuleNotFoundError` or
    `TclError` traceback.
