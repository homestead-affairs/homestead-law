"""Bite 4, end to end — the store → gate → surface pipeline, headless.

`demo.compose_demo` seeds a synthetic custody matter into the store, lists it and
opens two details entirely through `Window` and `serve()`. This is the plan's
'done when' run as a *pipeline* rather than against hand-built records: a real
matter, loaded from disk, composed through the gate — the L4 payload absent from
the list and present in the detail, and no L5 anywhere.

No display is opened; `view.run` (the tkinter drawing) is a thin consumer of this
same `Window`, and is exercised by `python -m homestead.app --smoke`.
