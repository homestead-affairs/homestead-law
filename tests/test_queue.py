"""The urgent queue — what the season owes, across every matter.

BUG-6 was the urgent queue: it hardcoded its matter list and workers' comp fell
out of it, never iterated. The load-bearing test here is that the queue iterates
`all_matters()` and nothing else, so a matter that exists is a matter the queue
reaches. The rest holds the rung model at the queue: an L5 deadline is not in it,
an L4 shows its derived form, and an unparseable date is a surfaced gap (I-8),
never a silent drop.
