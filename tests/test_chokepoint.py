"""I-16 — one authorization chokepoint. Bite 3, hardened after the bite-1-3 audit.

`serve()`, `serve_all()` and `ambient_rows()` are the *shape* of one door;
`rungs.py` says so about itself and adds the sentence this bite answers:

    A gate wired to one entry point is not a gate, and at Phase 2 it is wired to
    none.

The first version of this bite wired it by banning the literal `.payload`
attribute — and the audit broke it in the way the prior audits break things: the
scan enforced the *spelling* of the bypass, not the property. `getattr(record,
"payload")` in a surface file reached a sealed L5 payload and passed the suite,
exactly the desktop-leak-evasion shape ("the scan misses the leak it was written
to prevent"). A one-word change walked the SSN onto the screen, green.

So the rule is now stated as a property of the **surface layer** rather than of
one token. `Classified.payload` — the sensitive datum — may be reached in exactly
two engine modules:

  * `keep/rungs.py`, the gate, where `serve()` reads the payload to decide
    whether it may cross a surface; and
  * `keep/record.py`, the store, where persistence serializes it. Disk is not a
    surface (S1-S4).

Everywhere else that is the ban. And in the surface layer — `homestead/app/` —
the ban is wider, because a surface has no honest use for reflection at all: a
surface *renders what it is handed*, `Served.value` and `AmbientRow.text`, and
never reaches around the gate by any spelling. So `getattr`, `vars`, `__dict__`,
`dataclasses.astuple`/`asdict`/`fields` and `operator.attrgetter` are all a build
failure in a surface, whatever they name — the field-by-name reads the literal
scan could not see. `keep/dates.py` reflects over its own `Deadline`, which is
why the reflection ban is scoped to the surface layer and not the whole package;
an engine type reflecting over itself is not a gate bypass.

The regression fixtures are the important half, and they now plant the leak in a
real surface path and run the **package scan** over it — not the helper over a
string — so a passing suite means the actual enforcement caught the actual leak.
