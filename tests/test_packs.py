"""Bite 2 of docs/PLAN-first-runnable.md — the custody pack, and
`classify_schema` called for the first time.

Phase 2 built the refusal and tested it hard, but against synthetic schemas: the
exit criterion *"an unclassified field fails the build"* was, in the words of
`DECISION-unclassified-field-instrument.md`, *"a lock on an empty room."* This is
the room getting something in it — the first real schema in the package, a US-CA
custody matter, classified at **import** so an unclassified field stops the build
rather than surprising someone at runtime.

Packs are fixed: the operator-extends-a-pack question (P-3, Option A) is answered
*no* for v1, so a pack is a closed schema authored by the project, and the only
way a field goes unclassified is an author's omission — which is exactly what
import-time classification catches.

The rungs here are the model's own worked examples, not this file's invention: a
case number is `L3` in a *custody* matter (family records are commonly sealed)
where it is `L1` in a bankruptcy, an SSN is `L5`, a minor's name and schedule are
`L4`. `docs/homestead-rungs.md` § "Classifying a new field" and the surfaces
corpus are the provenance.
