"""The advisory content matcher, surfaced — `app/advisories`, the display model.

`keep/advise` decides; `Sidecar.advise` runs it read-only over a stored record;
`app/advisories.advisory_lines` is the last, thin step: it turns the `Advisory`
objects the store hands back into lines a pane can draw, and returns *nothing* to
draw when there is nothing to say. The view (`view.show_detail`) draws those lines
as a muted note under the record — never a dialog, never a block. This file holds
the display model to the same three conditions the matcher is built to, because a
surface is exactly where the leak and the false clean-bill would ship.

The tkinter drawing itself is not unit-tested here (it opens no display on a
headless box); `python -m homestead.app --smoke` imports it. What is tested is the
display *model* — the function that decides what text, if any, a pane shows.
